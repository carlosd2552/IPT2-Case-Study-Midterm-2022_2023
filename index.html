                    I have 1 year and 7 months of experience as a Customer Support Agent which vary from chat support, technical and billing support and in-bound calls. </br></br>
                    The first job that was offered to me was as a chat support for a huge retail company in the US. We had to cater their questions about their parcels, to coordinate with the third party companies which deliver their parcels and a little bit of billing on the side as well. </br></br>
                    The longest job that I had was being a technical and billing support. Troubleshooting their devices remotely on our end or helping them out in performing troubleshooting something on their end were the main calls that we usually get.
